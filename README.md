## About The Project

The brand style guide was provided and with it I was able to do the wireframe, prototype and create some components using Figma.

### Requirements

- Follow the design spec (Figma file)
- Render the three menu options using Javascript

### Stretch goals (optional)

- [ ] Offer a "meal deal" discount
- [ ] Allow users to rate their experience

### Optimizations/Problems to solve (optional):
- [ ] The form doesn't work as expected. Although it has required attr, the event listener overlaps, and the user can "submit" the form with empty fields.
